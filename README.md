# 👋 Hey there! I'm Angel T. Ramírez  

**`💻 Junior Front-End Developer | 🎨 Design Enthusiast`**

### 🧠 About Me  
I’m a recent graduate in **Software Development and Management Engineering**, passionate about creating clean, responsive, and user-friendly interfaces.  
I love learning new technologies, improving my code, and taking on creative challenges.  

When I’m not coding, you’ll probably find me exploring UI/UX ideas, tinkering with web animations, or watching tech videos with a cup of coffee ☕.
